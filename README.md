# Coral Color Exploit

I found a way to find to exploit the color given to the plant of a coral block from the [Lord of the Rings Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-lord-of-the-rings-mod-legacy) to extract ingame coordinates.

## About this project

When the game renders the coral block, a plant "block" will be rendered on top of the block. While the color of the plant appears to be randomly chosen, a coral block when placed at a given coordinate (X, Y, Z) will always have the same color regardless of world seed.

This mechanic can exploited to find the coordinates of where a screenshot was taken as long as:

1. There are enough coral blocks visible
2. Their relative position can be precised
3. The area to search has been narrowed down to be as small as possible
4. The direction of north must be known.

The more coral blocks in a picture, the better as the possibility of false-positives is greatly reduced, especially in a very large search area (100k x 100k). The relative position of the coral blocks from the top left corner of the pattern needs to be precise, or else it won't work correctly. It is also important to narrow down the area to be searched as much as possible. In the context of the Middle-earth dimension, this can be done by looking at the visual clues of a screenshot, like the color of the water, biome, etc. And finally, this program only works if the direction of the north is known; Some blocks like bricks on the ground and the sun will reveal that.

## Setup

At the current moment, it is necessary to manually compile the jar files and run the main function.

## How to use

## Coming Features

At this point, this program is more of a proof of concept than a practical tool to find a location using coral blocks. This may change in the future with a proper implementation. The following is planned to be added at some point:

* Remove the need to change the source code to insert a coral pattern, by adding an user input to the relative positions of the coral blocks
* Modify the program so any corners will be valid for a search area
* Add an option to specify that the direction of north is unknown, thus making the program search for the pattern in the four cardinal directions
* Add the possibility to change the number of threads used by the program
* Add a JPanel interface to facilitate the usage of the program
