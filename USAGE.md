# Coral Color Exploit Usage

<br>

## Using the program

First, it is necessary to identify the positions of the coral blocks. The image below shows how this should be done.

The gold block in the picture is on the top-left corner of the pattern, facing north. Every coral block position is relative to the coordinates of this gold block (x, y). A 5x5 pattern looks like this:

(x, z)     (x + 1, z)     (x + 2, z)     (x + 3, z)     (x + 4, z)\
(x, z + 1) (x + 1, z + 1) (x + 2, z + 1) (x + 3, z + 1) (x + 4, z + 1)\
(x, z + 2) (x + 1, z + 2) (x + 2, z + 2) (x + 3, z + 2) (x + 4, z + 2)\
(x, z + 3) (x + 1, z + 3) (x + 2, z + 3) (x + 3, z + 3) (x + 4, z + 3)\
(x, z + 4) (x + 1, z + 4) (x + 2, z + 4) (x + 3, z + 4) (x + 4, z + 4)\

There are five different colors for the coral plant: "Purple", "Yellow", "Blue", "Red", "Green". So, in the picture above, the first coral of the first line is blue (x + 3, z). To add this to the pattern to be search, go to the function "checkPattern" in "PatternSearch.java" and add the following:

getPlantIndex(x + 3, z, y) == BLUE

If we continue in the first line, we also have a yellow and a purple plant, if we add both we end up with:

getPlantIndex(x + 3, z, y) == BLUE &&\
getPlantIndex(x + 6, z, y) == YELLOW &&\
getPlantIndex(x + 7, z, y) == PURPLE\

Now, if we go to the next line, which has a green and red plant, we get:

getPlantIndex(x + 3, z, y) == BLUE &&\
getPlantIndex(x + 6, z, y) == YELLOW &&\
getPlantIndex(x + 7, z, y) == PURPLE &&\

getPlantIndex(x + 5, z + 1, y) == GREEN &&\
getPlantIndex(x + 9, z + 1, y) == RED\

Preferably, extract as many coral blocks as possible from the picture, to decrease the chances of getting the same pattern but in another location; A false positive. With all the coral blocks added, run the program. It will ask you to insert the coordinates and once done, the program will start running. If the search area is big, the program will take a while to finish.

As noted in [README.md](https://github.com/Wanadi/LotrModCoralExploit/blob/main/README.md), in the future it will no longer be necessary to change the code like this to insert a pattern.

## Tips

If you see an ocean, consider that when setting y-min and y-max. Minecraft oceans are normally at y=62 so keep that in mind. If you see the sun or clouds, you can figure out the direction of North. Some blocks, like bricks, always face the same direction on their top side, which tells the cardinal direction. The lines on the water texture are always pointing towards east or west. Sunflowers are always facing east.
